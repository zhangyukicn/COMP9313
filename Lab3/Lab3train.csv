MISC	The entire dining experience was wonderful!
REST	As much as I like the food there, I can't bring myself to go back.
REST	We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.
REST	It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.

REST	Their sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.
REST	From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.
REST	They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
REST	While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.
REST	However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
MISC	I just don't understand all the hype...
REST	The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.
REST	After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
REST	No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
REST	First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.
REST	The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.
REST	It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.
MISC	I went there with my friend last saturday.
MISC	After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.

REST	When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
REST	Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.
REST	Not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner.
MISC	I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.
REST	But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).
MISC	I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
MISC	I don't live in NY but my best friend does.
REST	The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
REST	They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
REST	Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.

REST	The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
MISC	We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
MISC	Once for dinner and once for brunch.

MISC	What a great place.
REST	With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
REST	Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
REST	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
MISC	I have been to Mary's many times and I like it.
REST	If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
REST	Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes.
REST	The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.
REST	just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent.
REST	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
MISC	This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.

REST	The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.
REST	Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
REST	On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.
MISC	I will never visit this restaurant again.
REST	The food is great, service is ok.
REST	Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ).
REST	The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!

REST	Service has always been friendly and efficient.
MISC	after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now, its official !
REST	Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
REST	Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.
MISC	In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.
REST	It's very spicy but not offensive.
REST	I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal.
MISC	Went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed.
REST	i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
REST	The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
REST	Nice value.
REST	Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
REST	The buffet had a nice selection.
REST	Service is top notch.
MISC	they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.
REST	The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
REST	service was efficient courteous.
REST	kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.
REST	Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food.
REST	It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.
MISC	But I'd go back
MISC	Brava La Pizza Fresca!
REST	Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.
MISC	On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.
MISC	I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
MISC	Everything a NY pizza joint should be.
REST	You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
MISC	I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
MISC	A pleasant surprise.
REST	The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.
REST	this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
MISC	I'm going back.
REST	We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.
MISC	I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
REST	I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
MISC	There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.
REST	Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for.
REST	We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them.
MISC	Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
MISC	I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
REST	They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
MISC	Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
MISC	This place is worth an one-hour drive.
MISC	I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.
REST	The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.
REST	Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
MISC	I often go there to eat with my family.
REST	We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
REST	Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!
MISC	If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
REST	Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
REST	However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
REST	The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.
MISC	We were very pleasantly surprised.
REST	The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.
REST	Try the sea bass.
MISC	Being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.

REST	When you want a piece of beef, head on over.
MISC	After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.
REST	Their Margarita is best I've had since I've returned from Naples!
MISC	Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier.
MISC	I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.
REST	What I didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.
REST	Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.
MISC	Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.
REST	His drinks are very inventive, delicious and classy.
REST	Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.
MISC	I loved it and would go again.
REST	at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.
MISC	Go inside and you won't want to leave.
REST	It's only $1.95 for a regular slice and $4.00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms.
MISC	by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!
REST	From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.
REST	Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
REST	The food was exceptional.
MISC	Unbelievable.
MISC	Don't go.
REST	Tasty steak, pork loin, the works.
MISC	Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
REST	We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.
REST	I am happy i did the food was awsome.
REST	Service was quick.
REST	And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
MISC	I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.
REST	I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
MISC	The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!
REST	They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.
REST	We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.
REST	Pizza and garlic knots are great as well, I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick!
MISC	I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
MISC	I love it.
MISC	After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
REST	The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
REST	I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.
MISC	Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.
MISC	Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
REST	Great vibe, lots of people.
REST	After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
REST	Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
REST	It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!
REST	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.
REST	I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.
MISC	I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
MISC	We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.
REST	Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer.
MISC	I'm no food critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years.
MISC	Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
REST	I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
REST	They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's.
MISC	My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.
MISC	It's convenient.
REST	Quick and friendly service.
REST	Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
MISC	Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
REST	We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.
REST	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
REST	Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
REST	stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
REST	I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience.
MISC	Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.
REST	Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
MISC	Get there before 7pm.
MISC	Beautiful experience.
REST	Good drink.
MISC	i would go again if i didn't have to pay.
REST	The price very reasonable.
REST	It is not worth for that bucks.
MISC	I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.
REST	Overall, not worth the money.
REST	they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.
REST	though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
REST	I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous.
REST	The dim sum here is only so-so.
MISC	Went here on a friend's reccomendation.
REST	Staff is very accomodating.
REST	The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
REST	The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge.
MISC	Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
REST	It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!
MISC	I don't think I would go again.
REST	The service is good and the resturant is clean.
MISC	I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.
REST	Every course was better than the next.
REST	You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.
MISC	Amma is nothing special.
REST	Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
MISC	I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
MISC	I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
MISC	I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.
REST	Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
REST	Sure, the setting is nice.
MISC	Never again!
REST	Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?
REST	For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.
REST	The drinks are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves.
MISC	I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
REST	The Thai food is good.
REST	The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM.
REST	If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.
REST	But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.
REST	my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.
REST	The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.
REST	All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best.
REST	The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).
MISC	Will never be back.
MISC	This place is great.
REST	Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
REST	And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
MISC	A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.
REST	This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
MISC	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
REST	There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.
REST	if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).
REST	It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.
REST	We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.
REST	Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?
REST	Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.
REST	They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.
REST	you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!
REST	Great food, great decor, great service.
REST	We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
MISC	Searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli.
REST	I have never had cheescake like this.
MISC	How do you rate home?
REST	The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
REST	And it was quick which is very important.
REST	We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.
REST	The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.
REST	What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.
REST	I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
REST	Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.
REST	The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
REST	It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food.
REST	The tastes makes your mouth water for more.
REST	skip dessert.
REST	If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place.
REST	Here's to the fake fish tanks too...
MISC	I loved it.
MISC	It's simply the best meal in NYC.
MISC	If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
REST	A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
REST	Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.
REST	I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
REST	Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.
REST	The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
REST	The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
MISC	For Park avenue I expected so much more.
REST	But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.
MISC	To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.
MISC	Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.
REST	Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.
REST	The food now is inconsistent.
REST	It is terrific, as is the value.
MISC	I can't wait for the nex time.
MISC	What for?
REST	My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the food.
MISC	I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?
REST	The food there are sastifying.
MISC	Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.
REST	I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
MISC	IT WAS HORRIBLE.
REST	I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic.
REST	I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
REST	we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.
MISC	Came looking for this place because I heard good things.
MISC	A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.
REST	Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.
REST	This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.
REST	We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.
REST	Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking.
MISC	Me and my girls will definitely go back.
MISC	I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.

REST	However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.
MISC	Its located in greenewich village.
REST	Wine list is not huge but def well selected.
MISC	The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door.
REST	The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!
REST	I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
REST	And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.
REST	The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
REST	The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
MISC	I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
MISC	We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
REST	We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
REST	I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.

MISC	I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
MISC	Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening.
MISC	Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.
REST	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
REST	Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
MISC	If you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.
MISC	This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!

REST	When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.
REST	Great sushi experience.

MISC	I was wrong.
REST	In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
MISC	Oh right, I should probably say something nice.

REST	There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!

REST	Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.

REST	You should pass on the calamari.
REST	The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.

REST	A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.
REST	Everyone is welcomed in as family.
MISC	I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.
REST	They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.
REST	The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
MISC	Good luck getting a table.
REST	I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.

REST	This place is always very crowded and popular.
MISC	Overall, excellent restaurant!
REST	For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance.
MISC	this one is definintely my least favorite.
MISC	A one women show!
REST	The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
REST	The food is nothing like its menu description.
REST	If you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal.

MISC	We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.
MISC	overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.
REST	Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.
REST	Plain and simple it's bad thai food.
REST	Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.
REST	Did I mention the wine?
MISC	After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.
REST	The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.

MISC	A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
MISC	We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
REST	My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.
REST	Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
MISC	Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
REST	Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.
REST	The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great!
REST	Very affordable and excellent ambient!
REST	The Pad Thai is excellent here, as well.
MISC	You can't go wrong here.
MISC	That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.
REST	My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.
REST	The sushi is average and the prices are anything but.
REST	I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.
MISC	Keep up the good work guys!
REST	Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.
MISC	despite the untasteful previous review...
REST	The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
REST	The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
REST	I've never been treated so rudely.
REST	Most importantly, food is excellent.
REST	Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
REST	For great chinese food nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.
MISC	Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!
REST	By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.
REST	otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.
REST	With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.
REST	Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.

MISC	I wasn't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special, but Tuesday Night.
MISC	I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.
REST	The decor is very simple but comfortable.
REST	Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
REST	Horrible food and Horrible service.
REST	What an amazing meal and experience!
REST	$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
MISC	THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.
REST	The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
REST	I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
REST	head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's.

REST	I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!
REST	First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...
REST	I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
MISC	We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
REST	The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.
REST	It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.
REST	We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.
MISC	I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
REST	The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.
MISC	DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
MISC	This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done.
MISC	I will not be coming here at 3am again.
MISC	Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...
REST	The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).

MISC	After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.
REST	Southern Indian cuisine is still there, too.

REST	What generous portions!
MISC	Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
REST	Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.
REST	Food and service was okay.
MISC	It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner.
MISC	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
MISC	Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!
MISC	My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.

REST	If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.

MISC	I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.
MISC	Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service.
MISC	I think locals rate this place so high.
MISC	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
REST	The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.
REST	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
REST	Food-awesome.
REST	Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.
REST	They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
REST	Service was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!).
MISC	Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.
REST	Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.

REST	The food was good too.
REST	Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.
MISC	This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!
REST	May, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.
MISC	I absolutely love this place!!!
REST	The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
REST	Why do people rave about the ambience.
REST	The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.
MISC	Don't be fooled by crowds of people.
REST	The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
REST	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
REST	Hats off to the chef.
MISC	If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.
REST	Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
MISC	Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.
MISC	We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.
MISC	A great choice at any cost and a great deal.
REST	The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
REST	Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family.
REST	The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
REST	they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.
REST	THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.
MISC	I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
MISC	Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.
REST	I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.
REST	Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.
REST	I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.
REST	We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
REST	NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
REST	Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.
REST	While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).
REST	We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?
REST	If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).
REST	The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
MISC	We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.
MISC	Ahhh...
MISC	The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
MISC	Go here.
MISC	I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
MISC	He always says, I don't have customers.

MISC	My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend.
REST	Service is average.
REST	They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.
REST	The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better.
REST	It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
REST	If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.
REST	I care more about the food and ambience.
MISC	I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
REST	Decor leaves something to be desired.
REST	like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.
REST	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
REST	I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.
MISC	I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
REST	I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.
MISC	But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.
REST	Again, the waitress was awesome.
MISC	Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.
MISC	The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.
REST	He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.
MISC	I would go back.
REST	One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
REST	When we sat, we got great and fast service.
MISC	(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).
REST	Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
MISC	Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
REST	Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.
REST	The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
REST	The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.
REST	But $1 for each small piece???
MISC	What more could you want?
MISC	Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
REST	I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.
MISC	When we arrived at 6:00 PM, the restaurant was practically empty.
MISC	It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
MISC	So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.
MISC	I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
REST	Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.
REST	This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.
REST	Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
REST	The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
REST	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
MISC	Went inside and I started to get excited.
MISC	I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.
REST	Beef noodle soup is good as well.
REST	The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
REST	Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.
REST	Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.
REST	Great staff.
MISC	Yeah, it's that good.
REST	(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
REST	A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
MISC	Tends to turn people away.
REST	so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.
REST	You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.
MISC	Is just the way it was in days gone by.
MISC	It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
MISC	You will find yourself returning quite often.
REST	Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
MISC	I'll be back soon.
REST	This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.
REST	Delicious crab cakes too.
MISC	I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.
REST	The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.
REST	I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
REST	The service is fantastic.
REST	The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
MISC	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
MISC	Sexy.
REST	The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.
REST	We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.

MISC	My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.
REST	My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.
REST	Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
REST	The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible.
MISC	I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
MISC	I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!
REST	The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
REST	Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.
REST	The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.
MISC	Was surprisingly disappointed.
REST	The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
MISC	I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.
REST	Great wine, great food.
REST	My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
MISC	I was glad I did.
REST	The food was really good, I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.
MISC	It hits the spot every time
REST	For all of you new to Indian food, try the Paneer Roll, it is a piece of heaven.
REST	He offers subpar service and has no personality.
MISC	A million better places to go in the city.
REST	Prices are very good.
REST	The food was very well prepared.
REST	Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.
MISC	We were very disappointed.
MISC	Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
REST	As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
REST	A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
MISC	I grew up on these bagels.
REST	When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
REST	Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.
MISC	I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures.
REST	It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.
MISC	THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
REST	Great service, great food.
MISC	I would highly recommend.
MISC	This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
REST	The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.
REST	Hopefully next time, I will save room for dessert.
REST	Our waitress was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing.
REST	The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.
REST	Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.
REST	Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
MISC	La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
MISC	I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
MISC	Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
REST	Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!
MISC	But too far east!
REST	I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.
MISC	Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.
REST	The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
REST	The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
REST	Much more reasonably priced too!
REST	The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
REST	Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
REST	Located at the end of a magnificent block.
MISC	I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC.
REST	After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
REST	It's true, this place is not cheap.
REST	The food was spicy and delicious.
REST	An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing.
REST	I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.
MISC	My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,
REST	The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
REST	Also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.
MISC	This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.
REST	try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.
REST	And they provided a delicious dessert on the house!
REST	The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.
REST	Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).
MISC	Fantastic!
REST	Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
MISC	I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.
MISC	I went here with my boyfriend and another couple.
REST	Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
MISC	Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
REST	Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid.
REST	You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.
REST	The sushi was awful!
REST	Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.
REST	It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials.
MISC	So sorry I can't rate this better.
REST	however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
MISC	My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
REST	My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions.
REST	Everyone was more then happy with his choices.
REST	Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.
MISC	I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
REST	And I could do without the cigar smoke.
REST	i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
REST	The service is descent even when this small place is packed.
REST	Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.
REST	Of course, it is crowded but who cares.
REST	Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!
REST	I've waited over one hour for food.
REST	Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
MISC	I will be returning.
REST	Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
REST	Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow.
MISC	Our teenage kids love it, too.
MISC	It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.

REST	The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.
REST	Waitstaff is great, very attentive.
REST	Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding.
REST	The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.
REST	The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.
REST	The prices were fantastic.
REST	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
REST	Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.
REST	Murray won't do it.
REST	We also had shared a house salad that was fresh.
REST	The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
MISC	Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
REST	While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.
MISC	They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.
REST	The setting is casual and romantic.
REST	There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
MISC	For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.
REST	Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it.
REST	Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
REST	The food however, is what one might expect.
REST	Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
MISC	All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
REST	Our server was very helpful and friendly.

REST	The fried dumplings are GREAT!
MISC	They are located in the middle of Chinatown!
REST	Not too crazy about their sake martini.
MISC	Definitely will be back!
MISC	At 6:30, we were the third party there.
MISC	We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.
REST	Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
MISC	I have been twice to this restaurant.
MISC	Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.
REST	Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
MISC	Go hungry and enjoy.
MISC	This restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.
REST	Pizza here is consistently good.
REST	Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
REST	The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.
REST	This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.
MISC	I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.
REST	Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.
MISC	I loved it and will be back soon.
REST	If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.
REST	I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.
REST	The staff is no nonsense.
REST	The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.
MISC	Horrible.
MISC	That place was awesome,,,  sally !
REST	This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
MISC	I would highly recommend it.
REST	Big and gawky on the outside.
REST	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
REST	Not enough wines by the glass either.
REST	The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
REST	We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich.
MISC	THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
REST	I had the best ravioli ever.
REST	Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.
MISC	I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible!
MISC	uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison.
REST	For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.
REST	There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
MISC	Went for a late weekday lunch.
REST	My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.
REST	The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
REST	The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.
MISC	Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).
MISC	I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.
REST	Cute and decorative.
REST	For the quality of food, a little too expensive.
REST	I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.
REST	The food is great and authentic.
MISC	I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.
REST	No you're going to go back because the food was good.
REST	The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
REST	Over 100 different choices to create your own.
REST	The service was attentive, yet discreet.
REST	But, nothing stands out about the cooking.
REST	Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.
REST	It might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.
REST	The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.
MISC	No apologies during restaurant week.
MISC	My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.
REST	We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
REST	In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.
REST	The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY.
REST	This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights.
MISC	This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.
REST	Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.
REST	To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.
REST	It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad.
MISC	Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.
REST	If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!
REST	A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
MISC	If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.
MISC	Old school meets New world.
MISC	Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!

REST	They treat me like family, morning and night.
REST	This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.

MISC	We will be back.
REST	The food was absolutely amazing!!
REST	Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.
REST	great wine list (italian), good food, service was INITIALLY fine.
MISC	However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
REST	The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
MISC	Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed.
REST	I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.
REST	Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
MISC	She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
REST	I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself!
REST	They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
REST	Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.
MISC	When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good pizza!
REST	For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
REST	Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.
MISC	they live up to the thai way of living.
REST	We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived.
REST	Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).
REST	I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
REST	The overall price tag was very very expensive, something I did expect.
REST	People are always friendly.
MISC	I plan on eating here more often.
REST	The service was great as well.
MISC	now if they could only get a toaster.
REST	I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
REST	Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.
MISC	Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere).
REST	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
MISC	I can't wait to go back.
REST	We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.
MISC	It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
REST	Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.
REST	Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.
MISC	No plans to return anytime soon.
REST	The filet mignon dish was superb!
REST	Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka.)
MISC	As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.
MISC	Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.
REST	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
REST	The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
REST	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
MISC	But that is highly forgivable.
MISC	Satisfying.
REST	I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.
REST	They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
REST	Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain.
MISC	I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
REST	The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
REST	Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.
REST	The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
MISC	Wonderful!
REST	One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.
REST	Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.
REST	Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.
REST	The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
MISC	Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
REST	The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.
MISC	We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.
REST	Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.
REST	Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.
REST	The staff is courteous and friendly.
MISC	I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!
MISC	So close, but not good enough.
REST	Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
REST	Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
REST	The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
MISC	You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.
MISC	but still my date was bad
REST	If presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works.
REST	Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
REST	I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
REST	The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
REST	The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
REST	Too cold to enjoy.
REST	From the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.
REST	The food was absolutely horrible!
MISC	Would definitely visit again.
MISC	I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
MISC	Not worth it.
REST	we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.
REST	The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
REST	What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.
REST	Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.
REST	Service was on par but not wonderful.
MISC	This place was not ALL THAT!
MISC	When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.
MISC	Never fails to please.
REST	He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.
REST	We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
REST	The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).
REST	The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.
REST	This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.
REST	Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.
REST	The food was boring and expensive.
REST	Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
MISC	So eat fast and order a lot.
MISC	This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
REST	The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.
REST	Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
REST	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
REST	The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.
REST	It is also extremely well priced.
REST	The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.
MISC	I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there.
REST	The burger was great, also.
REST	Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well.
REST	Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
MISC	I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.
REST	The service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.
REST	Aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.
REST	i recommend the thai popcorn :)
REST	If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.
REST	THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
REST	Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.
REST	This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
REST	The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.
REST	Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
REST	Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.
REST	We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.
REST	The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
REST	They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.
MISC	Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya).
MISC	Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.
MISC	brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.
REST	The food is amazing!!!!
REST	The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.
REST	Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
MISC	believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
MISC	I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself.
MISC	Just go and see for yourself.
MISC	Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.
MISC	No thanks!!!
MISC	Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
REST	Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
REST	Service was very friendly.
REST	You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.
REST	I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.
MISC	One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.
REST	ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).
MISC	Love YUKA.
REST	If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!
MISC	I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
REST	The fries are yummy.
REST	It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).
MISC	Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.
MISC	But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
MISC	Ciao Bella
REST	This place is incredibly tiny.
MISC	LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
REST	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
MISC	Very good value
MISC	My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
MISC	We visit at least once a month.
REST	Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.
MISC	enough said!
REST	Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
REST	I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
REST	For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.
REST	The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.
REST	The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
REST	Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.
REST	great eats, good times.
REST	The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.
MISC	Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
REST	Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.
MISC	Excellent experience.
MISC	I suspect this restaurant is what Rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive.
REST	We did have to wait at the bar for approx.
REST	sometimes i get good food and ok service.
REST	While this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.
REST	- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.
REST	Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
REST	Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.
MISC	As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
REST	The noodle and rices dishes taste great.
REST	all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.
REST	Good food.
REST	The waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely.
REST	They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.
REST	Pizza was a little soggy.
MISC	Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.
REST	The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
REST	It is thick and slightly soggy.
MISC	The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
MISC	I wish they would change back to what it was before.
REST	It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
REST	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.
REST	The dim sum however was very good.
MISC	I love going there!
REST	It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.
REST	The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
MISC	We left after one drink.
REST	And the food was fantastic.
MISC	Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
REST	If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
REST	We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC.
MISC	I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.
REST	Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city.
REST	The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
MISC	However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.
MISC	i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.
REST	But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.
REST	it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.
REST	Try the tandoori salmon!
REST	The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
REST	You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.
REST	From beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.
REST	You have to increase the service a lot.
MISC	Nice find.
REST	Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.
REST	The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.
MISC	I for one will never patronize them again.
REST	this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
REST	The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
MISC	Buon appetito!
MISC	This place is always packed.
REST	The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe.
REST	We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly.
MISC	Please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.
REST	($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).
REST	They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.
REST	The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
REST	My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.
MISC	It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
REST	Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
REST	the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.
REST	Great people watching as others do the same to you.
MISC	You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.
REST	Service here was great, food was fantastic.
MISC	So rude.
REST	Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
REST	Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
REST	Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna.
MISC	It was raining, and we figured why not?
REST	Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.
MISC	I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.
REST	Service was also very good.
MISC	It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.
REST	The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
MISC	It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.
MISC	We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
MISC	For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
REST	The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.
REST	Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
REST	Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.
MISC	In any event, even though its a bit on the pricey side, we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back.
REST	Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
MISC	I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
REST	Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.
MISC	A hearty two thumbs up!
REST	This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
REST	Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
REST	During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.
MISC	I agree.
MISC	I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
MISC	Don't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo.
MISC	Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
REST	We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
REST	We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
MISC	Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.
REST	The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
MISC	Faan is sooo good.
REST	The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
REST	The food was good.
MISC	Authentic bistro!
MISC	Okay, so I never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown.
MISC	We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.
MISC	I had a great experience.
REST	The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).
MISC	Avoid at all costs.
MISC	This is where the aforementioned line was.
REST	The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
MISC	It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.
MISC	Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
REST	Not pretentious and very economical.
REST	The prices are wonderfully low.
REST	The food was great.
MISC	Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.
REST	The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
REST	Over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine.
MISC	I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.
REST	We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.
REST	However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
REST	Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
MISC	Went there for an office lunch.
REST	The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.
REST	The beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good.
MISC	Probably would not go again...
MISC	This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.
REST	We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
MISC	and never strayed.
REST	Service was good and food is wonderful.
MISC	We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.
REST	Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.
REST	So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
MISC	Look elsewhere.
MISC	This time, I prefer not to go into detail.
REST	Killer Sushi!
REST	While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.
REST	The service was ok.
REST	A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
REST	Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
REST	To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside.
MISC	I went to Ruby Foo's after work with a group of 6.
REST	If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!
MISC	I haven't been to the other locations.
REST	The sides were ok and incredibly salty.
REST	They never came back to refill our glasses again.
MISC	Maybe tomorrow ;-)
MISC	I would definently recommend this restaurant.
REST	The food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.
REST	The service was typical short-order, dinner type.
MISC	I only have friends.
REST	great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
MISC	Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.
MISC	I really liked this place.
REST	They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.
REST	When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.
MISC	This is probably one of my new favorite places.
REST	I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
MISC	We will be back.
REST	The pizza is good though.
REST	The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.
MISC	We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street.
REST	My steak au poivre was one of the worst I've had.
MISC	It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.
MISC	One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
REST	I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!
REST	It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.
MISC	Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.
REST	Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).
REST	It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.
REST	The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back.
REST	If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.
REST	I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry.
MISC	The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
MISC	I'd definitely recommend this little place.
REST	The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.
REST	honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.
REST	I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
REST	Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.
REST	It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
REST	It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
REST	We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.
REST	But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high.
MISC	I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.
REST	Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
REST	Note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.
REST	The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
MISC	it helps if you know what to order.
MISC	It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.
MISC	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
REST	Everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.
REST	The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
REST	They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.
MISC	If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.
REST	Try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!
REST	Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.
REST	The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.
REST	I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
REST	This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
REST	Good food.
MISC	And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.
REST	The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.
REST	The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.
REST	love the food.
MISC	You will be satisfied.
REST	Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.
REST	The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
REST	Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.
MISC	So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise.
REST	For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.
MISC	I've never been disappointed.
MISC	Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
REST	go here for the drinks!
MISC	please don't fool us.
REST	Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
MISC	I've been here twice now.
MISC	Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.
MISC	We've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.
REST	And you're hungry a few hours later.
REST	The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.
REST	Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.
REST	The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
REST	The service was attentive.
REST	Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation.
REST	I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
REST	great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.
REST	Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.
MISC	If you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!
MISC	Don't waste your time, or money!!
MISC	We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
REST	Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
REST	we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.
REST	The wine list is excellent.
REST	The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.
REST	We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
REST	The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.
REST	Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....
MISC	I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere.
MISC	I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
REST	Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.
REST	Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare.
REST	The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.
REST	The pizza here is delicious.
MISC	That's why you have to pay more for that.
REST	The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
REST	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
REST	The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
REST	It's a small cute restaurant.
MISC	Went last Thursday.
REST	The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.
REST	I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
REST	whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.
MISC	Don't go there!
REST	but the service was a bit slow.
REST	The establishment scores big points in presentation and style.
REST	Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.
REST	I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!
MISC	Perhaps.
MISC	Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).
REST	Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.

REST	A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
MISC	This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.
MISC	Go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it.
REST	Great wine list, reasonably priced.--Sara
REST	Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.
MISC	Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time.
REST	We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue.
REST	Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).

REST	Service was prompt, friendly and great.
REST	The food is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it.
REST	The best pad thai i've ever had.

MISC	And that's no mean feat...
MISC	I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.
REST	Decor is charming.
MISC	Worth a visit.
REST	The pizza was great.
REST	We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
REST	The food options rule.
REST	The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
REST	The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
REST	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.
REST	The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.
REST	We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
REST	Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.
REST	We were pleasantly greeted.
REST	Really though, where's the seasoning?
REST	Always popular, always full, always a wait.
REST	Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!

MISC	If you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go.
REST	And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.

REST	The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.

REST	In fact, two people could really share one plate.
REST	The service is ok but could be better.
MISC	We weren't!
MISC	The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.
MISC	Nice place though.
MISC	I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.
MISC	When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.
REST	The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.
REST	My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.
MISC	This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.
REST	Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.
REST	The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.
MISC	I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!
MISC	Went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).
MISC	If you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what Rao's is all about.
MISC	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.
REST	The service is awful.
MISC	I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.
REST	Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
MISC	It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.
MISC	They also do a great job for restaurant week.
MISC	I will definetly be going back.
MISC	Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.
REST	Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.
REST	Food is great.
MISC	we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
REST	From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.
REST	All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.
MISC	I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.
REST	When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
MISC	Kudos Haru
MISC	This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.
REST	Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.
REST	Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.
REST	However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.
MISC	David, Daytona Beach, FL
MISC	This restaurant was way overhyped.
REST	While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.
REST	The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.
REST	Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.
REST	This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
REST	The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.
MISC	Definately check it out!!!
REST	but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
REST	The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
REST	But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
REST	I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
MISC	I was there on sat.
REST	sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
REST	Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
REST	Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had!
REST	To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.
REST	Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
MISC	I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner.
MISC	Our friends have not arrived yet.
REST	We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
MISC	But they do.
REST	It's just O.K. pizza.
REST	The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
REST	The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
REST	These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
REST	The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!
MISC	Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.
REST	They charge $6.00 for rice.
REST	All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.
MISC	We were less than impressed.
MISC	Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.
REST	Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
REST	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
REST	I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
MISC	I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- I dont mind.
REST	As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.
MISC	When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy.
REST	The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.
REST	The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
REST	The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
REST	I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
REST	The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.
MISC	We would return to this place again!
MISC	This is the best thing in Soho.
REST	Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
MISC	Boy was I wrong!
MISC	I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
REST	Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...
REST	Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.
REST	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.
MISC	it is not consistent.
MISC	happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone.
MISC	Love Pizza 33..
REST	You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
MISC	Its worth the wait though.
REST	Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).
REST	then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
MISC	great experience overall.
REST	The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.
MISC	Chance is a joke.
MISC	This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.
REST	Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!
REST	I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.

MISC	We were pleasantly surprised.
MISC	Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
MISC	I would highly recommend this place!
REST	My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
MISC	for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
MISC	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
MISC	Bravissimo !!
MISC	I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.
REST	Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
REST	Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order.
REST	The place was quiet and delightful.
REST	Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.
MISC	I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well.
MISC	I love the place.
MISC	It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
REST	The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.
REST	Food is great and inexpensive.
MISC	We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.
REST	The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
MISC	I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
REST	I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good.
MISC	Overall I would recommend it and go back again.
REST	A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.
MISC	Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.
REST	Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.
MISC	I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.
MISC	Check it out.
REST	I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
REST	As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
REST	They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
REST	This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
MISC	As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
REST	The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.
REST	This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
REST	The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.
REST	Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.
MISC	It was wonderful.
REST	Their sake martini is wonderful.
REST	If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
REST	And affordable.
MISC	If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.
REST	The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.
REST	After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!
MISC	This was the worst dining experience I've ever had.
REST	As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
REST	Spice is great Thai food, love the inexpensive appetizers.
REST	Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.
MISC	Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.
REST	Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.
MISC	Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.
REST	The meat dishes were only so-so.
MISC	If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.
REST	This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
REST	Their coffee is quite good too!
REST	It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
REST	The sauces used are also not that exciting.
MISC	I thought this place was totally overrated.
REST	My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.
REST	Also they were $15 each!
REST	Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
MISC	I am going to the mid town location next.
REST	Indoor was very cozy and cute.
REST	In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
REST	Service is great, takeout is good too.
REST	The food's as good as ever.
REST	Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.
MISC	Bon appettite!!
MISC	for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!
MISC	On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.
MISC	The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
REST	This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
REST	The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.
REST	My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
REST	Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
MISC	Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
REST	the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.
REST	Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
REST	Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
REST	All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.
REST	Not cheap, but not that expensive either.
MISC	On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.
REST	However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot.
MISC	I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
REST	Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.
REST	It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
MISC	The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.
REST	Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.
MISC	Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
REST	The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
MISC	This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.
MISC	Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.
REST	The food was so-so.
REST	It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.
REST	My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium.
REST	We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.
REST	So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.
MISC	Go for it!
REST	My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
MISC	My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.
MISC	Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.
REST	The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.
REST	The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
REST	Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
REST	Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
REST	Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.
REST	Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.
REST	We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which dim sum dish it was.
MISC	Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.
MISC	Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in NYC.
REST	Definitely not worth the price!
REST	The menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious.
REST	Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.
REST	Probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).
MISC	Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.
REST	Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.
REST	Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.
REST	We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.
REST	The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
MISC	I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
REST	(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
REST	The soup is pretty good too.
MISC	This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip.
REST	Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.
REST	They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
MISC	There's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style.
REST	Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).
REST	The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.
REST	The well mannered, pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ.
REST	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.
MISC	I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.
REST	and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?
MISC	Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.
REST	We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.
REST	Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
MISC	I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix.
REST	- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious).
REST	The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.
REST	The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.
REST	That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.
REST	Unfortunately, the food is outstanding, but everything else about this restaurant is the pits.
REST	I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!
REST	Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.
REST	Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.
MISC	Bravo, Blue Hill!
REST	Fish was overdone.
MISC	The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
REST	I've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste.
REST	During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
MISC	You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.
REST	The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
MISC	Enjoy!
REST	word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.
REST	Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
MISC	Would NEVER go back there.
REST	If you want to save some money, don't go here.
MISC	On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
REST	The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.
MISC	There are much better places in NY with better prices.
REST	Not worth the prices.
MISC	Fantastic place.
REST	I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
REST	and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.
REST	We had the most wonderful waitress.
REST	The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.
REST	We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.
REST	i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.
MISC	I highly recommend it.
MISC	keep up the good work.
REST	One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
MISC	You can't go wrong with this place.
MISC	But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing.
REST	The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.
REST	Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people.
REST	Also very inexpensive.
REST	My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.
REST	great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
REST	The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.
MISC	I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.
MISC	came here for restaurant week, didn't save much, but it was still great.
REST	Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
MISC	strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.
MISC	This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
REST	A++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.
MISC	I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.
REST	There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.
MISC	I go twice a month!
MISC	Not what I wanted to hear.
REST	If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.
REST	Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
REST	This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
REST	The food was very good, but not very thai.
MISC	We had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week.
REST	The food is great.
REST	Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
MISC	Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name.
MISC	I am French and I really felt like home!!!
MISC	Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.
REST	But who says Murray's is anything about service.
MISC	Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.
MISC	I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.
MISC	We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.
MISC	They are amazing!
MISC	Highly Highly Highly recommended!
REST	The 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.
REST	The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
REST	both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.
MISC	What more can you ask for?
REST	Its not the same if you have to sit inside.
REST	I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.
REST	They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
MISC	OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT.
REST	those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
REST	I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
REST	The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.
REST	No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.
MISC	Three strikes and this restaurant is out.
REST	The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.
MISC	Besides, we were on vacation!
REST	I had the black cod with yuzu sauce, which was wonderful.
REST	Unique apppetizers.
REST	The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
REST	Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.
MISC	Planet Thai is great!
REST	The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth.
REST	Decent wine selection too.
REST	We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.
REST	The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
MISC	I plan on stopping by next week as well.
REST	The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.
REST	The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.
MISC	I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.
MISC	Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
REST	Two words: Free wine.
REST	It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
REST	too large for just two people but nothing was left.
MISC	And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.
REST	The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.
REST	And the bill was outragous.
REST	The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.
MISC	I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening.
REST	The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).
REST	The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
REST	The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.
REST	The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
REST	My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well.
MISC	I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
REST	INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES.
REST	Great food, great lay out and awesome service.
REST	I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
REST	Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.
MISC	Get it together.
REST	Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15.
MISC	However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.
REST	Other apetizers and food
MISC	We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.
REST	And the prices were way to high for what you get.
REST	This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
REST	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
REST	We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.
MISC	We got most of it back at home with us.
MISC	We left, never to return.
MISC	Check it out
REST	Delivery is fast too.
REST	The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.
REST	Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.
REST	Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.
MISC	Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.
REST	The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.
REST	Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!
REST	The atmosphere is great!!!
MISC	Suan has challenged this loyalty.
REST	He was terribly thirsty after the meal too.
REST	The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
REST	Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
REST	We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.
REST	You must try the shrimp appetizers.
REST	Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
REST	They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
MISC	My roommate and I LOVE this place.
REST	not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere.
REST	BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.
MISC	I lOVE THIS PLACE!
MISC	Nothing special about this place.
REST	We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
REST	I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
REST	The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
REST	Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.
MISC	I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.
REST	Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.
REST	They all know you.
MISC	Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
REST	It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...
MISC	I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.
MISC	I LOVED THE SHOWS.
MISC	A wonderful place!
MISC	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
REST	Obviously run by folks who know a pie.
REST	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
REST	The staff is also attentive and friendly.
REST	Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
REST	When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
MISC	I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going.
REST	we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.
REST	Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.
REST	It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
REST	They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
REST	I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.
REST	The fried rice is amazing here.
REST	Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
REST	They've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.
MISC	Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones.
REST	We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
REST	Great food at reasonable prices.
REST	The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
REST	It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
REST	Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.
REST	All the food was hot tasty.
REST	Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
REST	Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
MISC	All I can say is WOW!
MISC	Definitely Highly NOT recommended.
MISC	Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent.I
REST	Service was prompt and courteous.
REST	From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.
REST	I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.
REST	Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.
REST	Light, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris.
REST	Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.
REST	Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
REST	They are the best bagels I've had.
REST	We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
REST	Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.
MISC	But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province.
MISC	I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.
REST	While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.
REST	Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
REST	A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.
REST	The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!
REST	Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!
REST	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
MISC	We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
MISC	I never had anything I didn't like here.
REST	I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
REST	The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.

REST	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
REST	I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.
MISC	We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.
REST	We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
MISC	Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently.
MISC	I would go back tho.
REST	While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate.
REST	The sake menu should not be overlooked!
REST	No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
REST	I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.
MISC	Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca).
REST	Great food, great prices, great service.
REST	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
REST	Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price.
REST	For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
REST	It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
REST	The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
MISC	Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
MISC	Wonderful at holiday time.
REST	Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
MISC	There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.
MISC	All in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back.
REST	The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.
MISC	After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
REST	While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.
REST	the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.
REST	The sandwhiches are out-of-this world!
REST	Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
MISC	I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
REST	The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
REST	Food was okay, nothing great.
REST	They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!
REST	Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.

REST	The place was nice and calm.
REST	I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.
REST	Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.

MISC	Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.
MISC	We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.
REST	The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.
MISC	The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.
REST	I think the stuff was better than Disney.
REST	Not impressed with the food.
MISC	VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up.
REST	So if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe.
REST	The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.
REST	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.
MISC	It could have been handled better.
REST	Food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh.
REST	The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
REST	The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!
REST	The service was superb, they treat you like family.
REST	Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
REST	I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.
REST	We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!
REST	The pizza was pretty good and huge.
MISC	I pray it stays open forever.
REST	The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
REST	Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
MISC	It was wonderful.
MISC	It is simply amazing.
MISC	Really.
REST	Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
MISC	Perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.
MISC	By the time we were done, it was past 1:00am.
REST	It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.
MISC	If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for Thia food.
REST	The food was actually aweful.
MISC	You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.
REST	I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.
REST	I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).
REST	It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food.
MISC	if this happens, just ask for real naan.
REST	The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.
MISC	You'll adore it.
MISC	Leave the kids at home!
REST	If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...
MISC	It was a very nice surprise.
REST	I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
MISC	Everything about this restaurant was special.
MISC	Bring your appetites.
REST	This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
REST	We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
REST	Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.
REST	I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
REST	Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!
REST	The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
MISC	I hate this.
REST	Odd for Ave B, not just odd, The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.
MISC	Want to impress?
REST	Try the cheesecake!
REST	The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
REST	But the coconut rice was good.
REST	The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
REST	This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
REST	I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.
REST	The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better.!!
REST	Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.
MISC	this place is amazingly bad.
MISC	They outshine HH.
MISC	Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
REST	This place is worth going even if only for their beer.
REST	They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
REST	I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
REST	We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
REST	sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
REST	Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!
REST	For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.
MISC	If you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been.
REST	All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
MISC	so i thought why not change it up a bit.
REST	We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
MISC	Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence.
REST	I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.
REST	Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.
MISC	Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
REST	Prices are in line.
MISC	Walk-ins are risky too.
MISC	instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.
MISC	I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
REST	Not a small feat for good french food in the area.
REST	They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
MISC	Less = More in their case.
