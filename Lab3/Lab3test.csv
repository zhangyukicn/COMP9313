REST	Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine.
REST	The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you.
MISC	No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination.
MISC	i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too.
MISC	The ambiance was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.
REST	The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a quesedilla.
REST	El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I've ever been to, has a great variety of tasty, mouth watering pizza's.
REST	The service was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.
REST	Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit.
MISC	I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes
REST	Chef Vincenzo, always there if you need him, is a real talent and a real Roman.
REST	If you're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service, definitely visit Curry Leaf.

REST	My daughter and I left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch.

REST	The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly.
MISC	I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out...but it's SO worth it.

REST	Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt.

MISC	THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS.
MISC	IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL.
REST	It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza (at least I don't think they ever made it before this year)...but it was worth the wait.
REST	I asked for a simple medium rare steak.
REST	Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious.
MISC	Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.
REST	Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa.
MISC	Ask for the round corner table next to the large window.
REST	Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of flavor.
MISC	The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.
MISC	I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people.
MISC	Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure.
REST	Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food.
REST	The food--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying.

REST	I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like.
MISC	I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it.

REST	Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions.
REST	I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area.

REST	I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice.
REST	You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu.
REST	The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific!
REST	Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?
REST	The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing.
REST	If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out.
REST	They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.
REST	Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.
REST	Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu.
REST	In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.
REST	I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
MISC	They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
MISC	then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people.
REST	The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere.
REST	After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.
MISC	With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere.
REST	A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices.
REST	Give it a try, menu is typical French but varied.
REST	It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice.
REST	but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group.
REST	the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food.
REST	We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came.
REST	It was good, but none of the flavors WOW.
REST	Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent.
REST	Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price.
MISC	Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed.
REST	for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and dessert.
REST	The space is traditional in feel.
REST	the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?
REST	the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.
REST	Good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line!
REST	Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast.
REST	I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant.
REST	The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks.
REST	rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!
REST	Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill.
REST	Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.
REST	Dishes denoted as "Roy's Classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs.
REST	The cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable.
REST	I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating.
REST	The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.
MISC	I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner, but nothing amazing.
MISC	Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt delivery, good value.
REST	Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good.
REST	i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.
MISC	It's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea.
REST	Not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine.
REST	It has good music, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele.
REST	The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs.
REST	And the food, well the food will keep you coming back.
REST	Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well.
REST	It's the conversations that make this a fun place to be.

REST	We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing.
REST	the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives.
REST	This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food.
REST	The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.
REST	the food - not worth the price.
REST	What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).
REST	The prices are not terrible.
REST	15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.
REST	The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal.
REST	Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.
REST	Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing.
REST	All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.
REST	Although somewhat loud, the noise was minimally intrusive.
REST	It's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what I go for.
REST	Tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons.
MISC	Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.
REST	Not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene.
MISC	You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here.
MISC	We'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night.
MISC	SUM IT: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it.
REST	We went there, no one greeted us.
REST	Dug the blue bar area too.
REST	We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.
MISC	I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, I was in your upstrairs dining area.
REST	Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices.
REST	At peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close.
REST	The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz?
REST	Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.
REST	Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.
REST	And these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized patties.
REST	There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast.
REST	Chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices.
REST	I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.

REST	The service was very attentive and very generous.
REST	We had tons of great food, wine, and desserts.
MISC	Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area.
MISC	OK, I've been to Dumont a few times now.
REST	The food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.
MISC	Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont.
REST	Not only do they have the best escargot in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler.
MISC	I've been to Sotto Voce several time, and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!
REST	Between my guest and I, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits.
REST	The Deco and ambiance was really romantic.
MISC	This is the best unknown restaurant in and around New York.
REST	Just go in and sample the greatest french food west of Daniel.
REST	For someone who used to hate Indian food, Baluchi's has changed my mid.
REST	Finally a curry that I can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later.
REST	All are GREAT - poori, naan, paratha all FRESH.
REST	Try the homemade breads.
REST	This place has beautiful sushi, and it's delicious CHEAP.

MISC	I read about this place in Time Out magazine.
MISC	It's a great find in Astoria.
REST	Great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries.
REST	The Yellowfin Tuna and Calf's liver are my favorites!
REST	Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.
REST	But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.
REST	Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love.
REST	They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).
REST	Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!
REST	good variety but nothing surprising.
REST	After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie.
REST	Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.
MISC	It's always quiet because it's awful.
REST	No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.
REST	Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix.
REST	Thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty.
REST	I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.
REST	Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.
REST	The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day.
REST	The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.
REST	It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere.
MISC	I have to say the place was awesome.
REST	The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.
REST	We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.
REST	The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
REST	If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.
REST	Unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any desserts.
MISC	The restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!
REST	Make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?
MISC	The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure.
REST	Although small, it has beautiful ambience, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a lil salty) and attentive service.
MISC	I didn't go there for food so I can't comment.
MISC	My friends and I go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and everytime can't resist walking out ready to burst.
REST	Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.
REST	Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.
REST	Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.
MISC	Bring your date and a bottle of wine!
MISC	Not only is this the best Thai restaurant I have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine.
MISC	Don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review.
REST	My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few.
REST	His food is excellent (and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14).
REST	The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me.
REST	The pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies.
REST	don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.
REST	Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (I hope Mom doesn't read this!).
REST	Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years, now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza ....Hanx
REST	Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great.
REST	We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the wine to the dessert menu.
MISC	Highly recommended...  As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the bar looks nice.
REST	The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.
REST	but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).
REST	It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses.
REST	Who said go when the place is quiet during the day?
REST	Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.
REST	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.
REST	good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine.
REST	Very nice touch that very much fits the place.
REST	However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.
MISC	We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.
MISC	If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.
REST	A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there.
REST	The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.
MISC	It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.
MISC	Slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?
REST	The sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.
REST	Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.
REST	The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.
REST	Prices even outside of restaurant week were great.
REST	A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.
MISC	Before the place didn't call my attention.
REST	And all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice.
REST	The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.
REST	for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.
REST	Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money.
REST	After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs.
REST	But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great.
REST	The room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink.
MISC	Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here.
REST	Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.
MISC	I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.
REST	It is bland and nothing extrodinary.
REST	I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.
REST	The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad.
MISC	Every time I visit NYC, I come here.
MISC	I've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago.
REST	The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of.
REST	several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.
REST	The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good...
MISC	We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.
REST	They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for.
REST	While the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had!
REST	The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.
REST	The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.
REST	The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.
REST	It' only open for lunch but the food is so good!
REST	If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things.
REST	" The menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherds pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians.
REST	How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices?!
